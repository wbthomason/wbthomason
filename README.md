### Hi!

**I'm on the academic and industry robotics research job market! If you have an open position you think I'd be a good fit for, get it touch!**

I am a roboticist with a PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu)
at Cornell University. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Kavraki Lab](http://kavrakilab.org/) at Rice University. I work with Professor Lydia Kavraki on combining symbolic and geometric planning. Specifically, I’m interested in improving the efficiency, robustness, and utility of robot task and motion planning (TMP), with a particular focus on making TMP under uncertainty practically useful. 

Though I primarily research **robot planning**, I’m also interested in ML and formal methods for
robotics, robotics research broadly, and programming languages.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, hiking, biking, playing/composing music, and writing open-source software (often in the form of [plugins](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) [for](https://github.com/wbthomason/pdf-scribe.nvim) [Neovim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim)).

You can contact me through the information listed on my [website](https://wbthomason.github.io/).
