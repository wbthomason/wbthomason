### Hi!

I am a roboticist with a PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu)
at Cornell University. I am currently a roboticist/research scientist at [The AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/) working on combining planning and learning for effective, scalable long-horizon robot manipulation. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Kavraki Lab](http://kavrakilab.org/) at Rice University.

Though I primarily research **robot planning**, Iâ€™m also interested in robot learning, hardware-accelerated robotics, programming languages, etc.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, hiking, biking, playing/composing music, and writing open-source software (often in the form of [plugins](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) [for](https://github.com/wbthomason/pdf-scribe.nvim) [Neovim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim)).

You can contact me through the information listed on my [website](https://wbthomason.com/).
