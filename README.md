### Hi!

I am a roboticist with my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu)
at Cornell University. I worked with [Professor Hadas Kress-Gazit](http://verifiablerobotics.com) on
**combining symbolic and geometric planning**. Specifically, I’m interested in improving the efficiency,
robustness, and utility of robot task and motion planning.

Though I primarily research **robot planning**, I’m also interested in ML and formal methods for
robotics, robotics research broadly, and programming languages.

I will be a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kavraki Lab](http://kavrakilab.org/) at Rice University starting in January 2022.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, hiking, biking, playing/composing music, and writing open-source software (often in the form of [plugins](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) [for](https://github.com/wbthomason/pdf-scribe.nvim) [Neovim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim)).

You can contact me through the information listed on my [website](https://wbthomason.github.io/).
